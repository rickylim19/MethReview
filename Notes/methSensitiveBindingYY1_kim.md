# Methylation-sensitive binding of transcription factor YY1 to an insulator sequence within the paternally expressed imprinted gene, Peg3

# Take-home messages

* single-bases methylation may change the binding of YY1
* methylation is imprinted in maternal 

# Abstract

* YY1 within Peg3 binding site contains one CpG dinucleotide
* Methylation of CpG abolishes the binding of YY1 
* Peg3-YY1 binding sites are methylated maternally not paternally
* YY1 functions a methylation-sensitive insulator

# Introduction

* YY1 binding to the motif is methylation-sensitive
* YY1 binding sites are differentially methylated between 2 parental alleles

# Results

* Single base change in a motif could disrupt the binding of YY1 (fig 3.D)
