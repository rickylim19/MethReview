#CpG islands and GC content dictate nucleosome depletion in a transcription-independent manner at mammalian promoters

# Take-home messages:

* CpG and GC accommodate open chromatin and supports paused transcription
* Nucleosome analysis with 10bp resolution 

# Abstract:

* CpG and GC: major element of mammalian promoters
* Correlation between CPG and GC with nucleosome depletion and positioning 
* Transcription not essential for nucleosome depletion
* Transcription influences a weak +1 and well-position nucleosome at CGI borders

# Results:

* Three groups of promoters defined by:
    - PolII occupancy
    - Nucleosome occupancy
    - directionality of paused transcripts (sense and anti-sense)
        * From TSS RNAseq 
    - 3 classes based on the peaks of Pol2 in 5'-3' of TSSs:
        - 1: upstream, antisense TSS
        - 2: around
        - 3: downstream
    - Characteristics of 3 promoter classes:
        - 1: Paused, GC-rich, bidirectional with PolII upstream of TSS
        - 2: Paused, GC-poor, bidirectional with PolII downstream ofTSS
        - 3: Less Paused, GC-rich, bidirectional wih PolII downstream of TSS
    - GC contents of the promoters dictate the best nucleosome positioning
    - Trends of GC with nucleosome density:
        * Increasing nucleosome density with increasing GC content (4%-34%)
        * Followed by the decreased nucleosome density -> increased GC (55-93%)
        * The shift from correlation to anticorrelation might be due to:
            - exp conditions for nucleosome reconstitution
            - absence of specific factors associated with high GC content 
        * CpG length and NDR size are correlated
            * Longer CpG ~ with longer NDR
    - PolII occupancy affect nucleosome postion butnot depletion at CGIpromoters
