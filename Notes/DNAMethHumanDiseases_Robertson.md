- Reading from `DNA Methylation and Human Disease` by Keith D.Robertson

    Questions:

    - How DNAmeths are being targeted to specific regions?
    (hint: involves the interactions between DNMT and chromatin proteins)

    
    Points:    

    - DNAmeth occurs mainly: repetitive regions (satellite & parasitic DNA)
    - DNAmeth `-|` transcription by:
        - Direct: inhibit TF binding
        - Indirect: recruit methyl-binding protein and their repressive markers
    - DNAmeth can be used to silence gene and maintain genome stability
    - Maintainance of genome stability: 
        - Prevent the abberant recombination events of repetitive DNA
        - Such abberants may lead to deregulation of nearby genes transcription
    - DNAmeth during development:
        - Viable embryonic stem cells but DNMT deficient die at differentiation
        - KnockoutMouse Dnmt1/and3b impairs in embryonic development
        - Knockoutmouse Dnmt3a dies within a few weeks of birth
        - Loss of normal DNAmeth in somatic cells -> loss of growth control
    - Method studying methylated regions:
        - RLGS (Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning)
        - RLGS to analyze the methylation status of CpG islands
        - Principle:
            - DNA digestion by `Not1` (methylation-sensitive enzyme)
            - Radiolabelled fragment on the site where the DNA is digested
            - Methylated sites are not digested and therefore not labelled
            - Gel-separation
        - Weakness:
            - Does not cover the whole CpGs
            - Identification in region instead base resolution
    - DNAmeth-cancer:
        - Hyomethylation on repeat-rich DNA'->'genomic instability
        - Genomic instability via mitotic recombination events
        - Genomic instability such as transposon activation
        - Gene-specific hypomethylation:
            - Melanoma antigen (MAGE) in cancer-testis gene 
            - Calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) in color cancer
            - Serine Protease inhibitor (SERPINB5) in gastric cancer
            - Putative oncogene $\gamma$-synuclein (SNGG) in brease and ovarian
        - Global hypomethylation vs Gene-specific hypomethylation:
            - Global: Early in tumorigenesis`->`genomic instability and changes 
            - Gene: Late to adapt with local environment and promote metastasis
        - Hypermethylation on TSG (Tumor Suppresor Gene)
