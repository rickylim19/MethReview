Imprinted genes are marked at their imprinting control elements
The least marker is DNA methylation
Imprinting to choose the expression of diploid genes (mum and dad genes)
Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed in one copy either from mum or dad
Non-imprinted genes are genes that are expressed in two copies
Parental-expression genes are unequal parental genes contribution in embryo
Imprinted genes are inheritance not sex
Sex determines the parental-expression genes
- E.g: genes in Y-chromosomes males genes (XY) 
- E.g: genes in X-chromosomes females (XX) `->` double dose in females
- E.g: mitochondrial genes contributed by maternal chromosomes
- Three first imprinted genes identified:
    * igf2r `->` maternal expression
    * igf2 `->` paternal expression
    * h19 (lnc RNA) `->` maternal expression. 
    Note: hg19 and igf2 cluster together `->` peak cluster in imprinted genes
- Imprints can regulate multiple genes via long-range regulatory elements
- Imprint: epigenetic modification to distingusih two parental copies of a gene
- mouse: Imprinted clusters: 3-12 imprinted genes, span: 100-3700 kb of DNA
- The majority of imprinted genes in any one cluster:
    - Imprinted protein-coding mRNA
    - At least `->` imprinted lncRNA
- Imprints seem to work in long-range cis-acting regulators on multiple genes
- Imprinted genes function on embryonic or neonatal growth regulators
    * Growth promoter: Igf2, Peg1, Peg3, Rasgrf1, Dlk1  (paternal expression)
    * Growth retardation: Igf2r, Gnas, Cdkn1c, H19, Grb10 (maternal expression)
    * Behavioral and neurological: Nesp, Ube3a, Kcnq1
- Imprinted genes found in placental mammals, and marsupials 
bur not in egg-laying mammals
- In placental mammals, direct influence of embryo on maternal resources
- 3 Features of genomic imprinting:
    * growth regulatory functions of imprinted genes
    * Restrictions to placental and marsupial mammals
    * necessity of paternal genome in fetal development
- Hypothesis on genomic imprinting:
    * parental conflict
        - Paternal-expressed imprinted genes to increase embryonic growth
        - Maternal-expressed imprinted genes to suppress embyronic growth
    * trophoblast defense
        - Maternal-risk of being anatomically-equipped for internal reproduction
        - Imprinting silences genes promoting placental development
        - Imprinting activates genes suprresing placental development
- genomic imprinting to regulate the nutrient transfer parent `->` offspring
- imprint genes are controlled and clusterd by ICE (Imprint Control Element)
- Size of gene clusters (80 -3700 kb) `->` provisional or predicted
- Common feature of imprinted gene clusters:
    * gametic DMR (differentially Methylated Region), defined as
    * imprint in gamete, in one parental chromosome in embryonic diploid cells 
- DMR acts as ICE (Imprint Control Element)
    * Maternal: Igf2r, Kcnq1, Gnas, Grb10, and Pws '->' oogeneis
    * Paternal: gf2 and Dlk1 `->` spermatogenesis
- Example of DMR:
    * igf2 cluster with DMR located at 2kb of H19 lncRNA
    * This DMR is paternally methylated and maintained in all somatic tissues
