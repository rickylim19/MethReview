# Analysis of DNA methylation from regio to single-base resolution

## Region-base DNA methylation studies

### Kelly, et al (2012)
They studied links between DNA methylation and nucleosomal positioning at 20bp-resolution in IMR90 cells (lung fibroblast) and GBM (Glioblastoma) using NOMe (Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation)-seq method.
This method allows the profiling of methylation and nucleosomal positionings simultaneously, hence providing better sensitivity in their studies than two profiles in isolation. In NOMe-seq, the nucleosome positioning is derived from the methylation of GpC by M.CviPI enzyme when GpC is not proctected by nucleosome. The methylation positioning is obtained by following conventional bisulfite treatment. The unmethylated CpG is converted into U whereas the methylated CpG remains unconverted.
In these cell lines, they found anticorrelation of nucleosomal occupancy and DNA meth at CTCF regions, but not in promoters. At CTCF regions, nucleosome occupancy is high with DNA methylation peaks in between, i.e, in the linker region between nucleosomes. In promoters nucleosomal depletion is correlated with low DNA methylation. This provides a genome-wide evidance for the expressed CpG promoters characterized by lack DNA methylation and nucleosome depletion region. 
Furthermore using bioinformatics analysis that separate within reads and population reads from NOMe-seq, they could identify genes likely to act in divergent chromatin alles, mainly at imprinted loci on the X chromosome.

### Fenouli, et al (2012)
They studied how nucleosome depletion is explained by CpG islands and GC content not essentially by transcription at 10bp resolution in mouse cells. 
Transcription only influences a weak +1 and well-positioned nucleosome at CGI borders.
Trend of GC with nucleosome density is as follows: increasing GC content (4%-34%) correlates with increasing nucleosome density. This trend is followed by decreased nuclelosome density which is anti-correlated with increased GC (55-93%). The shift phenomenon from correlation to anti-correlation might be to experimental conditions or the absence of specific factors associated with higher GC content.
Whereas the size of CpG and Nucleosome depletion region (NDR) are well correlated, in which, longer CpG length correlates with longer NDR
