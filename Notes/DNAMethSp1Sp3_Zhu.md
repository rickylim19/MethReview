# Methylation of Adjacent CpG Sites Affects Sp1/Sp3 Binding and Activity in the p21Cip1 Promoter

# Take-home messages:
* Human lung cancer, H719 treated with depsipeptide unable to activate p21 exp
* Depsispetite is the HDAC inhibitor `->` gene activation
* The inactivation of p21 in H719 was due to hypermethylation on p21 promoter
* In p21 promoter harbours the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites
* The hypermethylation around the consensus Sp1-binding sites reduces sp1binding
* The inhibition of Sp1 bindings leads to p21 inactivation
