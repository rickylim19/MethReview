# DNA methylation presents distinct binding sites for human transcription factors

# Take-home messages:

* TFs, e.g KLF4 binds to methy and unmeth DNA within distinc sequences
* Mutations of sequences (KLF4) affects to methy DNA but not unmethy, vice versa
* Meth and unmethy DNA binding activity of KLF4 depends on distinct sequences
* KLF4 binds methy or unmethy DNAmotif in diff seq context`->`dual specificity
* The binding of KLF4 affects the activation of downstream gene expression
* The dual specifity is accomodated by the functional separable domain in KLF4 
* Bioinformatics ChIPseq and methylome of KLF4 in H1 cells reveals
    - preference to the methylated motif similar found both in vivo/vitro

# Abstract

- Protein-micrroarray approach to find TF with methylated CpG-binding activities
- Test the binding to DNA-methylated binding motifs

# Digest
- Methylation disrupts the interaction between DNA-TF directly or
    * indirectly by recruitment of other methyl-binding proteins
- Protein microarray to screen 1300 TF and 210 co-TF 
- Screening for TF binding activity to some 150 different stretches of methyDNA
- Found 47 proteins binding methylated CpG sites,
    The majority with preference for specific DNA sequences
- Some TFs and co-TFs bind to methyl and non-methyl DNA with distinct sequences
- These two types of bindings are independent, show by:
    * mutation on KLF4 from binding to methylated DNA do not prevent
      binding from non-methylated DNA
- This work suggests that methylated cytosine act as fifth base 
    * important of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression

# Result

- TF binds distinct sequences dependent on their DNA meth
- Methylation in distinc sequences exhibit dual-specificty
- Dual-specificity towards methy and unmeth binding motifs
- ARID3B shows competitive binding, bind either meth or unmeth motif
- KLF4 shows non-competitive binding `->` > 1 binding domain
- The binding of KLF4 with 5mC DNA motif
    * Asp460 and Arg458 of KLF with van der walls with 5mC
- Methylation of KLF4 motif affects the gene expression shown by:
    * the mutation of R458A and D460A abolishes the downstream expression
