# Methylation adjacent to negatively regulating AP-1 site reactivates TrkA gene expression during cancer progression

# Take-home messages:

* Methylation on non-CpG islands drives the expr of TrkA during cancer progress
* Methylation on AP-1 sites blocks the AP1 repressor on TrkA gene
* Methylation blocks the binding of Jun homodimers to AP1-like sites
* The blocking was considered to lead to the TrkA gene activation
* This methylation on non-CpG provides versatility and plasticity during cancer
* Epigenetic analysis on subpopulation of pancreatic cancer (microdissection)
* Correlation TrkA and methylation expression during cancer progression 
* The correlation mainly observed at perineural invasion-the center of the tumor
